### Scores

Little experiment in letting the LLM doing the heavy lifting. Kinda just scrapped this together.
Enter text & attributes, then the model processes and displays scores. The app is meh, but I think it shows the simple idea, just give the model, let it do all the smart stuff.

Also made it on replit, hadn't been on it in a while, wanted to try it out.
